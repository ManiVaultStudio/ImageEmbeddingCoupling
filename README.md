# Coupled Exploration of High-Dimensional Images and Hierarchical Embeddings

This project implements the methods presented in the publication 
> Vieth, Alexander, et al. ‘**Interactions for Seamlessly Coupled Exploration of High-Dimensional Images and Hierarchical Embeddings**’. Vision, Modeling, and Visualization, edited by Michael Guthe and Thorsten Grosch, The Eurographics Association, 2023, [doi: 10.2312/vmv.20231227](https://doi.org/10.2312/vmv.20231227), [pdf](https://diglib.eg.org/bitstream/handle/10.2312/vmv20231227/063-070.pdf)).

The method is implemented in the visual analytics framework ManiVault ([Github](https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01751)) and the code will be open-sourced once ManiVault itself goes open-source (expected late September/early October).
