# Coupled Exploration of High-Dimensional Images and Hierarchical Embeddings

This project implements the methods presented in the publication "Interactions for Seamlessly Coupled Exploration of High-Dimensional Images and Hierarchical Embeddings" presented at VMV 2023.

The code will be added once the visual analytics framework ManiVault (https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio, https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01751) is open-sourced (expected late September/early October).
